Which Generation Are You?
Try finding your ancestors and offspring with code.
Create a function that takes a number x and a character y ("m" for male, "f" for female), and returns the name of an ancestor (m/f) or descendant (m/f).
If the number is negative, return the related ancestor.
If positive, return the related descendant.
You are generation 0. In the case of 0 (male or female), return "me!".
Examples
generation(2, "f") ➞ "granddaughter"

generation(-3, "m") ➞ "great grandfather"

generation(1, "f") ➞ "daughter"
function generation(x, y) {
	//insert code here
}
