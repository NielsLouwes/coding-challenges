A person wants to determine the most expensive computer keyboard and USB drive that can be purchased with a give budget. Given price lists for keyboards and USB drives and a budget, find the cost to buy them. If it is not possible to buy both items, return  -1.

Example:
keyboards =[40,50,60]
drives = [5,8,12]
b = 60

The person can buy a 40 keyboard + 12 USB drive = 52, or a 50 keyboard and a 8 USB drive = 58.

Choose the latter as its the more expensive option.
Output: 58

Example 2:
keyboards [10,20,30]
drives = [3,5,8]
b = 10

Output: -1 (no combinations are possible because 10 euros isn't enough to get both)
